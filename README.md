This is a take on the classic Pong game.

In Pong two players compete to see who can keep the ball in the court longer (very similiar to Ping Pong). 

The right paddle is controlled by the up and down arrows. 
The left paddle is controlled by the "w" and "s" keys. 

As the ball moves forward to you, hit the ball before it goes out of bounds so you don't lose.
